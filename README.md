# Project Overview: Real-Time Data Processing and Analytics for an E-commerce Platform

## Objective:
Participants will develop a real-time data processing system for an e-commerce platform that collects and processes data such as customer interactions, orders, product views, and sales in real-time. The project will involve creating a data pipeline that collects real-time data from a streaming source (like Kafka or a simulated stream), transforms the data, and loads it into a data warehouse. The data will be processed and analyzed using Spark, Databricks, and other cloud services like Azure.

## Week 1: Data Warehousing and SQL Concepts

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to DWH concepts and importance in real-time analytics
- SQL basics for creating, querying, and managing data in the warehouse
- Using SQL DML statements for data manipulation and query optimizations

### Capstone Project Milestone:
**Objective**: Design a Data Warehouse schema to store real-time e-commerce data (e.g., customer orders, product interactions).

### Tasks:
1. Design Schema: Create tables to store customer data, product data, and order data.
2. Data Manipulation: Insert, update, and manage data using SQL.
3. Querying Data: Write SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, order data, and product interactions.

### Example Code:
```sql
-- Create schema for e-commerce platform
CREATE TABLE customer_dim (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    location VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE product_dim (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE order_fact (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    order_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    order_date TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert sample data into the tables
INSERT INTO product_dim VALUES (1, 'Smartphone', 'Electronics');
INSERT INTO customer_dim VALUES (2001, 'Bob', 'California');
```

### Outcome:
By the end of Week 1, participants will have designed a Data Warehouse schema and managed data with SQL for real-time e-commerce data.

## Week 2: Real-Time Data Processing with Python

### Topics Covered:
- Python fundamentals for data extraction, transformation, and loading
- Real-time data collection using simulated streams or Kafka
- Python-based ETL processing for real-time data

### Capstone Project Milestone:
**Objective**: Use Python to extract and process real-time e-commerce data and load it into the Data Warehouse.

### Tasks:
1. Simulate Real-Time Data: Use Python to simulate real-time data streams (e.g., customer interactions, orders) and load them into the Data Warehouse.
2. ETL Pipeline: Develop a real-time ETL pipeline to transform and load the data into the warehouse.

### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import random
from datetime import datetime

# Simulate a real-time data stream for orders
def simulate_order_stream():
    product_ids = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    customer_ids = [2001, 2002, 2003]

    while True:
        order = {
            'order_id': random.randint(1001, 9999),
            'product_id': random.choice(product_ids),
            'customer_id': random.choice(customer_ids),
            'quantity': random.randint(1, 5),
            'order_amount': random.uniform(50, 500),
            'order_date': datetime.now()
        }
        yield pd.DataFrame([order])

# Stream and load real-time data into a SQL table
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///ecommerce.db')
for order_batch in simulate_order_stream():
    order_batch.to_sql('order_fact', con=engine, if_exists='append', index=False)
    print("Order batch loaded into the warehouse.")
```

### Outcome:
By the end of Week 2, participants will have implemented a real-time ETL pipeline using Python to simulate and process streaming e-commerce data.

## Week 3: Real-Time Data Processing with Apache Spark and PySpark

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Apache Spark for real-time processing
- PySpark for handling large-scale real-time data

### Capstone Project Milestone:
**Objective**: Process and analyze real-time data using Apache Spark and PySpark.

### Tasks:
1. Set Up Spark Streaming: Configure Apache Spark and PySpark to process real-time data streams.
2. Data Processing with PySpark: Use PySpark to process large-scale, real-time e-commerce data and analyze it in real-time.

### Example Code:
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pys
